<b>Keywords: Time management, Self-tracking, Productivity, Mental wellbeing, college student</b><br>
Many college students struggle with time management. While the majority of studies address how to tackle time management to improve productivity, attempts to identify what constitutes poor management have been lacking. To unpack the complex nature of time-management challenges, we analyzed 284 perceived time-wasting events of 31 college students through a two-week diary study.

<b>Keywords: Social computing, Communication, care-hospital</b><br>
FamCom is a service which aids a patient in care hospital to feel more intimate with family members by improving the quality of conversation. We conducted survey, contextual inquiry, personas, scenarios and user test using low and high-fidelity prototypes to enhance the quality of conversation. According to our research lack of conversation topics depreciates the quality of conversation. FamCom provides conversation sources to family members to increase the intimacy between patient and family members.

In this study, we proposed a Facebook-based social bot displaying depressive symptoms and disclosing vulnerable experiences that allows users to practice providing reactions online. We investigated how 55 college students interacted with the social bot for three weeks and how these support-giving experiences affected their mental health and stigma.

Many college students struggle with time management. While the majority of studies address how to tackle time management to improve productivity, attempts to identify what constitutes poor management have been lacking.

In this work, we present Calm Station, an interactive desk object which generate dynamic motions of a metal marble on a wooden tray. Calm Station is designed to convey daily notifications with abstract, poetic movements. It allows users to remain focused while doing desk work, reading, or relaxing by transferring distracting notifications, including updates and messages.

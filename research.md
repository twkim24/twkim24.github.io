<b>Keywords: Mental wellbeing, Mental health, Social bot, Human-bot Interaction, College student</b><br>
In this study, we proposed a Facebook-based social bot displaying depressive symptoms and disclosing vulnerable experiences that allows users to practice providing reactions online. We investigated how 55 college students interacted with the social bot for three weeks and how these support-giving experiences affected their mental health and stigma.

##### Understanding University Students’ Experiences, Perceptions, and Attitudes Toward Peers Displaying Mental Health-related Problems on Social Network Sites
by <u>Taewan Kim</u>, and Hwajung Hong <br>
<b>Keywords: mental health, social media, social support, peers, peer support, self- disclosure</b><br>
College students are at a vulnerable age; among those with serious mental health problems, this period is frequently when the first episodes appear. As a result, college students are increasingly disclosing their vulnerable, stigmatized experiences on social networking sites (SNSs). Understanding students’ perceptions and attitudes toward their peers who are dealing with mental health problems is vital to the efforts to eliminate peer exclusion and foster social support. In this paper, we investigate how students recognize, perceive, and react to peers who display mental health related challenges on SNSs in South Korea, where young adults are the age group that is most at risk for suicide. We discuss design implications for SNSs that would help platforms facilitate support exchanges among peers.

In this work, we present Calm Station, an interactive desk object which generate dynamic motions of a metal marble on a wooden tray. Calm Station is designed to convey daily notifications with abstract, poetic movements. It allows users to remain focused while doing desk work, reading, or relaxing by transferring distracting notifications, including updates and messages.

<b>Keywords: Social computing, Communication, Care-hospital</b><br>
FamCom is a service which aids a patient in care hospital to feel more intimate with family members by improving the quality of conversation. We conducted survey, contextual inquiry, personas, scenarios and user test using low and high-fidelity prototypes to enhance the quality of conversation. According to our research lack of conversation topics depreciates the quality of conversation. FamCom provides conversation sources to family members to increase the intimacy between patient and family members.

<b>Keywords: Time management, Self-tracking, Productivity, Mental wellbeing, College student</b><br>
Many college students struggle with time management. While the majority of studies address how to tackle time management to improve productivity, attempts to identify what constitutes poor management have been lacking. To unpack the complex nature of time-management challenges, we analyzed 284 perceived time-wasting events of 31 college students through a two-week diary study.

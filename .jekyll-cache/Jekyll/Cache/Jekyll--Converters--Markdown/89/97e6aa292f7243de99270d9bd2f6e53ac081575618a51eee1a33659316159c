<p><b>Nov, 2019</b>: Our paper titled “In Helping a Vulnerable Bot, You Help Yourself: Designing a Social Bot as a Care-Receiver to Promote Mental Health and Reduce Stigma” got accepted to CHI 2020. Big thanks to Mintra and Advisor: Hwajung Hong.</p>

<p><b>Aug, 2018</b>: I moved into Seoul National University (Interdisciplinary Program in Cognitive Science) as a PhD Student.</p>

<h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I’m a PhD student in the DxD(data interaction design) Lab at Seoul National University advised by prof.Hwajung Hong. I have received a master’s degree in Creative Design Engineering from <a href="https://www.unist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">National Institute of Science and Technology(UNIST)</a> advised by Prof.Hwajung Hong. There, I joined DxD (Data Interaction Design) Lab where we focus on designing systems that empower individuals and crowds toward creativity and connectivity. I received a bachelor’s degree in Industrial Design and an interdisciplinary degree in Entrepreneurship from <a href="https://www.handong.edu/eng/" target="_blank">Handong University</a>. My research interests include Social Computing, Conversational agents, Interactive system design for Mental &amp; Physical Welbeing, and Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
